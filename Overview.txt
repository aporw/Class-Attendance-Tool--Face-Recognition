
Once arguments are read, a graph object(class FaceRecGraph, file tf_graph) is created and passed to MTCNNDetect class to call its constructor. This creates MTCNNDetect class object face_detect. This face_detect object will be used by core functions later to call detect_face function. 

core functions: These use face_detect and extract_feature objects. extract_feature object depends upon type of model. 
1. camera_recog
2. create_manual_data
3. getNames
4. readNames

camera_recog and getNames uses 4 objects to perform task in order:
1. call detect_face function with face_detect obejct from MTCNNDetect class (mtcnn_detect.py file)
2. call align function with aligner object from AlignCustom class (align_custom.py file)
3. call get_features function with extract_feature object from FaceFeature class (face_model.py file)
4. call findPeople function (find_people.py file)

create_manual_data and readNames uses 4 objects to perform task in order:
1. call detect_face function with face_detect obejct from MTCNNDetect class (mtcnn_detect.py file)
2. call align function with aligner object from AlignCustom class (align_custom.py file)
3. call get_features function with extract_feature object from FaceFeature class (face_model.py file)
4. Writes featurs in json format in txt file


Example VGG

mode - VGGcamera
1. Create object for FaceFeature class to get generate features with next function
2. Identify person calling camera_recog function with findPeople which shows person's name on the face and quits on pressing q

mode - VGGinput
1. Create object for FaceFeature class to get generate features with next function
2. Write data in VGG txt file calling create_manual_data


mode - VGGpicture
1. Create object for FaceFeature class to get generate features with next function
2. Identify person calling getNames function with findPeople which shows person's name on the face
and quits on any key


mode - VGGpic_input_one
1. Create object for FaceFeature class to get generate features with next function
2. For a given path, takes all images of that person, calls readNames to write vectors in VGG_pic txt file

mode- VGGpic_input_all
1. Create object for FaceFeature class to get generate features with next function
2. For a given path with subfolders as each person's images, calls readNames to write vectors for each person in VGG_pic txt file
